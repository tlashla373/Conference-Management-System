                <p class="para" align="justify">The Institute of Technology, University of Moratuwa (ITUM), launched its first-ever research symposium in 2013 with the goal of cultivating a 
                    robust research culture within the institution. Since then, it has become an annual hallmark of the ITUM calendar serving as a distinguished platform to articulate 
                    and disseminate diverse and intricate research endeavours.</p>
                    <br>
                
                <p class="para" align="justify">From its inception, the research committees of ITUM adeptly organized six symposiums, thereby facilitating a scholarly environment where ITUM academic
                     staff could document and engage in meaningful discourse regarding their multifaceted, subject-specific research projects. In a significant expansion of its vision,
                      the 2019 symposium introduced a limited number of slots for industry researchers, granting them the opportunity to share their invaluable professional insights into
                       industry-related research.</p>
                    <br>

                
                <p class="para" align="justify">The establishment of the ITUM Research Unit (ITUM-RU) in 2020 further broadened the horizons of research at ITUM. In 2021, the symposium was opened to
                     researchers from other esteemed higher education institutions, universities, and industries across Sri Lanka. However, the 2021 symposium was conducted in a virtual
                      format in response to the global pandemic, ensuring the continuity of scholarly exchange.</p>
                    <br>
                
                <p class="para" align="justify">In 2022, the ITUM-RU extended the symposium’s reach by inviting international scholars, thereby fostering global collaboration in various technology-related
                     domains. This pivotal year culminated in the renaming of the symposium to the "International Research Conference of ITUM 2022," reflecting its enhanced scope and significance.</p>
                    <br>
                
                <p class="para" align="justify">The following year, 2023, witnessed a further elevation of the conference, as ITUM-RU collaborated with the International Institute of Management Sciences (IIMS)
                     under the theme "Industry 5.0 – Prospect and Retrospect." This partnership underscored our commitment to addressing contemporary challenges and opportunities in the field.</p>

                <p class="para" align="justify">This year, the Research Unit of ITUM is poised to host the 3rd International Research Conference under the theme <b>"Exploring New Frontiers: Innovative and Cross-disciplinary
                     Approaches to Sustainable Engineering Practices."</b> The abstract book will be published as the “Proceedings of the 3rd International Research Conference of ITUM 2024, bearing the
